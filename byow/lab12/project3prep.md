# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:
In my implementaion, I did not do it in time before the lab solution so I recorded the solutions to refer back to later.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:
We can think of the hexagons as rooms and hallways because it needs to not overlap and make sense in sense 
of style where each room and hallway is given a space.

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:
I would write a method where you would need to add layers first.

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer:
The hallway is what connects rooms. The hallways are more narrow.
