# Water-Game
This game was created for my final project in cs61b, data structures class at UC Berkeley Fall 2020 under Josh Hug.
The point of the game was to open a new game, type in a seed that would generate a randomized world, and use WASD keys to move a flower around the generated world. The flower is to collect water in exchange for points. The world can be saved and reloaded to the same place as it was before. The cursor displays which object you are on when it is hovered over an object.
